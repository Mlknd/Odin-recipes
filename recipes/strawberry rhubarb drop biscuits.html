            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) frozen unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons reserved fruit syrup</li>
            <li>3/4 cup cold buttermilk</li>
            
            <h3>Egg wash(optional):</h3>
            <li>1 large egg (optional)</li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons water (optional)</li>
            <h3>Lemon Icing Drizzle</h3>
            <li>1/3 cup packed powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice, plus more as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut ribs of rhubarb in half lengthwise and slice into 1/4-inch pieces; place into a bowl. Add cubed strawberries and 2 tablespoons sugar. Toss to combine, cover, and let fruit macerate in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a mixing bowl; whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Drain fruit in a strainer set over a bowl. Reserve the syrupy juices that pass through.</li>
            <li>Grate frozen butter into the flour mixture, while stirring with a fork several times to coat butter pieces with flour. Add 1/4 cup sugar, and drained fruit, mixing with a fork until fruit is coated with flour.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the reserved fruit juices, and pour in buttermilk. Mix with a fork just until the dry ingredients are incorporated into the dough. If the mixture is too dry to come together, add a little more buttermilk. If it seems too wet, and sticky, add a little more flour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silpat mat.</li>
            <li>Scoop or spoon equal portions of dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Whisk together egg and water in a small bowl. Brush biscuits with egg wash, and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
            <li>
                Mix powdered sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice together in a small bowl for the lemon icing. Fill icing into a piping bag or a plastic bag with the tip cut off and drizzle icing over cooled biscuits.</li>
        </ol>
